# Notes - tidy the data

The results of the following samples are marked as **NA** :

- 5 empty sapmles : 178, 101, 146, 107 and 119
- row H, column 3 to 12 in plate 15 : no samples
- col 5&6 at 240min in plate 6 : technical issue (these sapmles were repeated in plate 15)
- col 9&10 at 1800min in plate 6 : technical issue (these sapmles were repeated in plate 15)
- the sample 49 in plate 6 : did not find this sample at that moment (have not been repeated in plate 15, might need to repeat it later)
- the sample 82* in plate 5 and 7 (did not distinguish from the sample 82)
